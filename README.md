# SaneQL Web UI Application 

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the prototype application of <a href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2024/papers/p48-neumann.pdf">A Critique of Modern SQL And A Proposal Towards A Simple and Expressive Query Language"</a>, developed using Vite and React. This application serves as a tool for translating SaneQL queries into SQL, which are subsequently processed by Umbra.
